# Computer Science Build Week 2 Code Challenges:
## Add Two Numbers Python
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

- Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
- Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
- Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

## Contains Duplicates Python
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

* Example 1:

> Input: [1,2,3,1] 
>
> Output: true
>
> Example 2:

> Input: [1,2,3,4]
>
> Output: false
>
> Example 3:

> Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
>
> Output: true

## Two Sum Python
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
>
> return [0, 1]

## Pascal Triangle Python
- Givena non-negative integer numRows, generate the fist numRows of Pascal's triangle.
- In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
